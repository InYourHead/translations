# Translations

Situations App is officially available in English and in Finnish.

Other languages for the application are currently provided by volunteers. They are provided as is, without any support or warranty from Pastilli Labs or the volunteers.


# Updating

To download or update the application language, go to application Settings and press Update button under the Translation section. Application checks the device language and updates corresponding language pack automatically if available. 

NOTE: As the application evolves over time, parts of it may not be translated at all times.


# Volunteering

Here are the steps to help us provide Situations for different languages: 

Clone or download the source translations ("C" folder) on this GitHub page.

Create a new folder with an appropriate two letter identifier based on your target languagea and copy the source files there. Identifier may also contain country code if necessary (for example "en_US" or "pt_BR"). Change also the language identifier ("C") inside the translation files.

Do your translation magic.

Send the files back to us (e-mail: support(at)pastillilabs.com) or create a pull request.

Source files are standard Qt translation files. Use any text editor or Qt Linguist to edit them.

NOTE: All translations are public & freely available to anyone, including Pastilli Labs, for commercial or non-commercial use. Pastilli Labs reserves the right to add, remove & modify any translations. Translations must not contain any licensed and/or inappropriate material.
