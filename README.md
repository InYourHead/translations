# Updating the app

To download or update the application language, go to application Settings page and press Update button under the Translation section. Application checks the device language and updates corresponding language pack automatically if available. 

**NOTE:** As the application evolves over time, parts of it may not be translated at all times.

# Volunteering

Here are the steps to help us provide Situations for different languages: 

+ Download or clone the repository (see the green button).

+ Go to sources/situations -folder.

+ Copy the "C" folder and rename it with an appropriate two letter identifier based on your target language. Identifier may also contain country code if necessary (for example "en_US" or "pt_BR"). Change the language identifier ("C") also inside all the translation files.

+ Do your translation magic.

+ Send the files back to us (e-mail: support(at)pastillilabs.com) or create a pull request.

Source files are standard Qt translation files. Use any text editor or Qt Linguist to edit them.

**NOTE: All translations are public & freely available to anyone, including Pastilli Labs, for commercial or non-commercial use. Pastilli Labs reserves the right to add, remove & modify any translations. Translations must not contain any licensed and/or inappropriate material.**
